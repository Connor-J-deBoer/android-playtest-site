    <h2>The What</h2>
    <p class="description">Backyard Beat Up is a 3rd person 2D casual fighting mobile game in which everyone only has one hit point. You play as Devin Twan, a 5 year old younger brother looking to prove to his older brother (Cevin Twan, 7 years old) that he is the strongest in the house. Fight and beat all 4 of Cevinâ€™s friends to work your way up to the biggest fight of your life (so far) and put Cevin in his place.</p>
    <h2>The How</h2>
    <p class="description">The player character will follow your finger along the screen, to jump you have to swipe your finger up quickly, to attack you have to press a second finger on the screen</p>
    <h2>The Why</h2>
    <p class="description">A couple of friends need a project while the industry recovers. We choose a mobile platform because we wanted to be able to share our work with anyone at any time</p>
